# HyperTweak Project Reference

This file records verifiable project facts. Agent execution rules live in
[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).

## Overview

HyperTweak is a Xiaomi HyperOS/MIUI libxposed API 102 module. Its settings UI
uses Jetpack Compose with Miuix components. The module provides system and
application hooks for customization across the processes listed in
`app/src/main/resources/META-INF/xposed/scope.list`.

## Toolchain and Dependencies

- Android `compileSdk 37`, `targetSdk 37`, `minSdk 35`; Java source and target 21.
- Android Gradle Plugin `9.3.0`; Kotlin Compose plugin `2.4.10`.
- libxposed API and service `102.0.0`; Miuix `0.9.3`; DexKit `2.2.0`.
- Native packaging is limited to `arm64-v8a`.

## Layout

Kotlin sources are under `app/src/main/kotlin/com/takekazex/hypertweak/`:

- `hook/` contains the entry point and hook implementation. `hook/base/` holds
  shared hook infrastructure; `hook/rules/*` contains feature-specific rules.
- `ui/page`, `ui/effect`, `ui/liquid`, `ui/navigation`, and `ui/theme` contain
  Compose screens and UI infrastructure.
- `util/` contains shared utilities. JVM tests are under `app/src/test/`.

## Key Components

- `HookEntry` dispatches module initialization for each process.
- `Preferences` owns runtime preference access and cross-process synchronization.
- `XposedServiceManager` manages the libxposed service boundary.
- `BaseHooker` provides common hook lifecycle and resolution behavior.
- `DexKitManager` resolves obfuscated classes with cached runtime metadata.

Hook handles and hot-reload state belong to the hook lifecycle layer; runtime
preference changes are consumed through `Preferences` and must not be coupled
to UI-only state.

## Scope and Features

The scope file is the single source of truth. It currently contains:

```text
system
com.android.systemui
com.miui.home
com.takekazex.hypertweak
com.android.settings
com.miui.aod
com.miui.securitycenter
com.miui.powerkeeper
com.xiaomi.scanner
com.milink.service
com.xiaomi.bluetooth
```

These cover the system server, SystemUI, Launcher, the module's own process,
Settings, AOD, Security Center, PowerKeeper, Scanner, MiLink, and Bluetooth.

Feature areas include system/SystemUI hooks, slider percentage display, an AOSP
back gesture, AOD/fingerprint/navigation-bar behavior, Settings injection,
restart-scope controls, logging, and theme/UI settings.

## Build and Test

```bash
./gradlew :app:compileDebugKotlin
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest
./gradlew :app:lintDebug
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
./gradlew :app:assembleRelease
```

The repository currently has JVM unit tests but no device-level Compose or UI
tests. Release CI uses JDK 21, a signing keystore, `BUILD_CHANNEL=stable`, and
verifies the APK certificate with `apksigner`.
